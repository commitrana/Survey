Hey there!! A beginner here !!
This is a basic (and I mean **basic-basic**) survey form that I built while learning HTML.  
I'm currently focusing on building small projects like this to strengthen my fundamentals before jumping into styling, JavaScript, or anything too wild.

## 😄 Why I Made This:

I wanted to get some experience with:
- HTML form elements like `input`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `fieldset`, etc.
- Setting up form validations using attributes like `required`, `min`, and `type`
- Pushing code to GitHub and learning how version control actually works
- Hosting a live project using **GitHub Pages** (feels good seeing your work online ngl 😭)
- to practice learning git workflow.
  
# Live Project:

# 🛠️ Tech Used:

- HTML5 (no CSS yet-but will be there very soon)
- Git + GitHub
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## 📌 What I'm Working On Next:(reminder to myself as well)

- Adding **CSS** to make the form look cleaner (right now it’s just raw HTML vibes 🥲)
- Making it responsive for mobile users
- Maybe adding JavaScript for basic validation or interactions
- Figuring out how to store form responses (eventually)

## Just Being Honest:

This isn’t some big project. It’s not perfect.  
But I’m proud of it ...because I actually built it, hosted it, and learned a lot in the process.

If you’re also learning like me:  
> Start small, finish things, and put them online. It really helps!
